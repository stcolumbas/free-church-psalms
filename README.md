==================

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/monty5811/free-church-psalms/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/monty5811/free-church-psalms)



The purpose of this project is to make Sing Psalms (copyright Free Church of Scotland) and the Scottish Psalter (1650 revised words) easily downloadable for churches.

## Quickstart

If you just want to download the files please go to [psalms.stcsfc.org](https://psalms.stcsfc.org).

## Formats

The words are available in a variety of formats to suit the different technologies congregations may be using:

 * Microsoft PowerPoint (pptx)
 * PDF
 * ProPresenter
 * Plain Text

If your church is using a different piece of software, please get [in touch](mailto:production@stcolumbas.freechurch.org) and we can hopefully add it to the rest.


## Contributing
